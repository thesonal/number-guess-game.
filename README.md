# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)

A simple and interactive **number guessing game** built with Python.  
The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess it.  
Hints guide the player whether the number is higher or lower until the correct guess is made.  
The game also tracks the number of attempts, adding a fun competitive element.
